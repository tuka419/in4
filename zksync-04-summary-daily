China and Australia are proof that governments do not have to like each other to do business.

When Anthony Albanese arrives in China on Saturday, he will be the first Australian prime minister to visit in seven years.

His three-day trip comes in the wake of plummeting relations between the two countries - and Canberra's growing military ties with Washington.

In recent years Australia and China have accused each other over human rights violations and perceived threats to national security. Public perceptions of the other side are more negative than they have ever been.

But when it comes to trade, they cannot afford to let go of each other. At the peak of their trading relationship in 2020, almost half of Australia's exports went to China.

By way of comparison, at around the same time roughly 9% of all US exports and only 5% of British exports were being sold to China.
